# Contributing to Whirli Client

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the Whirli Client and its packages, which are hosted in the [Whirli Organization](https://github.com/whirli) on GitHub.

> Note: This document is due to be fleshed out.

## Contribution

The master branch should contain only released code. This should come under a particular release, and tagged in git.

The develop branch is the main target for development. It is the trunk for unreleased code. The develop branch should always be
a stable release candidate.

To contribute, please branch from develop. When complete, please PR back to develop, ensuring you've met all requirements
as laid out in the PR description. This particularly includes making changes to the CHANGELOG.

## How to list my changes to the CHANGELOG

Please see [Keep a ChangeLog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) for instructions on how to do this.
